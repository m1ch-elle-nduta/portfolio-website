        <p>Nature photography encompasses a wide range of photography taken outdoors and devoted to displaying natural elements such as landscapes, wildlife, plants, and close-ups of natural scenes and textures. Nature photography tends to place a stronger emphasis on the aesthetic value of the photo than other photography genres, such as photojournalism and documentary photography.
